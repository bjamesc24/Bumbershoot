# release.yml
# -----------
# Release workflow for Project Bumbershoot.
#
# CURRENT STATUS: Placeholder — not yet active.
#
# What this will eventually do:
#   - Trigger on a version tag (e.g., v1.0.0) pushed to main
#   - Use Expo Application Services (EAS) to build the app
#   - Produce APK (Android) and IPA (iOS) build artifacts
#   - Optionally submit to app stores
#
# Prerequisites before activating:
#   - EAS account and project configured (eas.json)
#   - EXPO_TOKEN secret added to GitHub repository settings
#   - App signing credentials configured in EAS
#
# To enable this workflow, replace the placeholder job below
# with actual EAS build steps once the above is in place.
